**Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL)**,
part of the NASA `Transform to Open Science (TOPS) <https://zenodo.org/records/8087116>`_ Training (TOPST) initiative.

SCHOOL
===============================================================================

Project Overview
*******************************************************************************

Project Overview
SCHOOL’s objective is to develop curriculum for ScienceCore that incorporates
NASA Earth Science Applications use cases and data into the data science life
cycle as part of `NASA’s Open Source Science Initiative (OSSI) <https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/>`_. The project
consists of seven 2.5 hour learning modules designed to fit both online
(self-led) and in person instruction. Modules focus on demonstrating the data
science life cycle with varying themes: **Water, Health and Air Quality,
Environmental Justice, Disasters, Wildfires, Agriculture, and Climate.**

School Pedagogy
*******************************************************************************

Inclusive Teaching
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*   Inclusive teaching fosters an environment where diversity is celebrated and
    reflected in course content.

*   Marginalization of various populations is overcome by using multiple and
    diverse examples crossing gender, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers.
    Course content is designed to provide a variety of modes **(visual,
    textual, interactive)** for content delivery and for student expression
    which is absent of assumptions about student abilities or experiences.

Active Learning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The process of encouraging students to not only focus on doing, but also
    to think critically about what they are doing.

*   Active learning engages students through activities such as reading
    discussing, executing code, and writing, in addition to listening
    Evaluations

*   In asynchronous learning environments, active learning strategies move
    beyond listening to prerecorded materials and toward active engagement by
    directing students to do something, such as looking at an image
    interacting with the real world, or retrieving past knowledge.

Evaluations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   To foster inclusive teaching and active learning, it is critical that

    *   expectations for assessment are clearly communicated
    *   that assessments are timely
    *   that examples of ideal results are presented

*   Clearly defined learning objectives allow instructors to assess metrics of
    student performance, and to provide feedback early and often.

TOPSTSCHOOL Module Structure
===============================================================================

Each 2.5 hour thematic module, broken down into five 30-minute lessons, will
demonstrate the full data science life cycle and connect those processes with
open science principles.

    * - Module Component
      - Data Science Life Cycle/Open Science Integration
      - Example Activity

    * - Lesson 1
      - Generation and collection
      - Identify and obtain data sources. Generation could include
        spatializing tabular data.

    * - Lesson 2
      - Processing and storage
      - Data integration tasks are completed. Local and cloud storage options
        are demonstrated.

    * - Lesson 3
      - Management and analysis
      - Creation of metadata to inform uses and structure. Statistical
        techniques applied.

    * - Lesson 4
      - Visualization and interpretation
      - Creation of charts and maps. Interpretation thought questions and
        examples from other work.

    * - Lesson 5
      - Open Science and Community Engagement
      - How to share these results openly. Practice of engaging with existing
        and emerging community networks.


Project Timeline
===============================================================================
The project will commence on July 1, 2023 and end on June 30, 2025. Learning
modules will be developed using the SAFe methodology which will allow for the
regular incremental release of thematic content as it becomes available.
