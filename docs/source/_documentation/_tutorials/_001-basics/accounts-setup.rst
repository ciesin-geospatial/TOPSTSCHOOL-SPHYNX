In the world of open science, certain digital tools and platforms are
indispensable for sharing research, collaborating with peers, and managing
your scientific identity. Before diving into your open science journey,
setting up accounts on some key platforms will empower you to fully
participate in this transparent, collaborative ecosystem. Below, we'll walk
through the importance of each account, real-world use cases, and practical
examples of how they are utilized in open science workflows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`GitHub` is one of the most powerful tools in the world of collaborative
research, open science, and software development. It's more than just a
platform for storing code |html-dash| it's a vibrant community where you can
contribute to projects, share data, and collaborate with fellow researchers
from all over the world. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, GitHub
provides the tools you need to manage projects, contribute to
:term:`Open Science`, and share your findings.

.. dropdown:: Importance for Open Science

    - **Version Control.** Keeps track of all changes to your code, making it
      easy to revert to previous versions if necessary. This is crucial in
      research projects where :term:`reproducibility` is key.

    - **Collaborative Research.** Enables multiple researchers to work
      together on the same project, with features like forking, pull requests,
      and issue tracking. For instance, a team of climate scientists may use
      GitHub to manage code for analyzing climate models. Each team member
      contributes code and reviews changes through pull requests.

    - **Open Access.** You can make your repositories public, allowing others
      to view, use, and contribute to your research. Example for this would be
      an ecologist sharing a Python package on GitHub that automates the
      analysis of satellite imagery, allowing others to replicate or build on
      the work.

At its core, GitHub is a hosting service for version control using Git. This
means it helps you track changes in your work, collaborate with others
seamlessly, and manage multiple versions of a project. Many of NASA's open
science projects, including the :term:`TOPS` :term:`SCHOOL` initiative, use
GitHub to share their work and invite contributions from the global community.
So, setting up a GitHub account is the first step toward being part of this
exciting, inclusive movement.

Let's walk through how to create your personal GitHub account and get started
with open science!

Creating GitHub Account
===============================================================================

#. Go to `GitHub`_.
#. In the upper-right corner of the page, click on the **Sign Up** button to
   start creating your personal account. GitHub will guide you through the
   process, one step at a time.
#. You will be asked for a **username**, **email address**, and to create a
   **password**.

.. important::

    Your **username** will be your unique identity on GitHub, and it's how
    others will find and recognize you on the platform. Your **email address**
    is important because GitHub will use it to communicate with you. Make sure
    it's an email address you check regularly. Choose a **strong password** to
    protect your account. GitHub recommends using a combination of upper and
    lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols for added security.

4. Once you've entered your details, :term:`GitHub` will send a verification
   email to the address you provided.
#. Check your inbox (and your spam folder if you don't see it) and click the
   link to verify your email address.
#. Without verifying your email, you won't be able to perform certain tasks
   like creating repositories, so this step is important!
#. You'll be asked to complete a simple CAPTCHA (a quick task to confirm
   you're not a robot). Just follow the instructions, and you're good to go.
#. GitHub will prompt you to choose a plan. For most users just starting with
   :term:`Open Science`, the **Free** plan is more than enough. You can always
   upgrade later if you need advanced features like private repositories, but
   for now, you're all set with the free option!
#. Once your account is set up, you'll land on your GitHub dashboard. This is
   your home base for creating projects, exploring repositories, and
   contributing to open science. GitHub offers a helpful tutorial called
   "`Hello World <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/
   hello-world>`_" to get you started with the basics |html-dash| like
   creating your first repository, etc.

But before you move on, take a moment to congratulate yourself! You've just
taken a significant step toward being part of the open science community.

Securing Your GitHub Account
===============================================================================

GitHub is an integral platform for collaborative research and open-source
projects, but with this openness comes the need for robust security measures.
By following best practices, you can ensure your research and data are
protected against unauthorized access. Here's a detailed guide on securing
your GitHub account.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We strongly recommend that you configure MFA for your account. MFA is an extra
layer of security that can help keep your account secure. Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account by
requiring a second form of verification beyond just your password. Here's how to set it up:

- Navigate to Security Settings by clicking on to your
  :menuselection:`Profile --> Settings --> Password and authentication`
- Under the "Two-factor authentication" section, click the button to begin the
  setup process. Choose your authentication method. :term:`GitHub` offers
  several MFA options.
- Follow the setup instructions and remaining prompts to complete the MFA
  setup. Ensure you test the MFA method to confirm it's working properly.
