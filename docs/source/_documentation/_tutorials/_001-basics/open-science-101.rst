:term:`Open Science` is a global movement that aims to make scientific
research more accessible, transparent, and collaborative. At :term:`NASA`,
we're embracing this transformation through our :term:`TOPS` [#]_ initiative,
which seeks to democratize scientific knowledge and empower individuals from
all walks of life to engage with and contribute to the research process.
:term:`Open Science` is not just a set of practices; it's a movement that
seeks to revolutionize the way research is conducted and shared across the
globe. At its heart, open science aims to make scientific research more
transparent, accessible, and collaborative. By embracing open science,
researchers can accelerate discoveries, increase public engagement, and ensure
that science serves humanity more effectively.

The :term:`SCHOOL`, **Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in
Learning** program is an essential part of NASA's TOPS initiative. It provides
a structured, immersive curriculum designed to introduce students,
researchers, and science enthusiasts to the core principles of Open Science.
Whether you're just starting out or already well-versed in scientific
research, our mission is to help you harness the power of Open Science to
drive meaningful change.

What is Open Science?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At its core, Open Science seeks to remove the barriers traditionally
associated with scientific research. In contrast to conventional research
models |html-dash| where data, methodologies, and findings are often limited
to a select few, Open Science promotes the idea that all aspects of the
research process should be openly shared and accessible to everyone.

.. dropdown:: Openness means...

    - **Sharing Data.** Making raw data available for others to use, analyze,
      and build upon.

    - **Transparent Methods.** Sharing methodologies, tools, and software
      openly to enhance reproducibility.

    - **Open Access.** Providing access to scientific publications and research
      outputs to ensure that knowledge reaches a wider audience.

:term:`Open Science` promotes transparency, encourages collaboration, and
accelerates scientific discovery by allowing others to replicate studies,
validate results, and build upon previous work. By adopting Open Science
principles, the research community can collectively tackle the world's most
pressing challenges |html-dash| from climate change and environmental
degradation to public health crises and social inequalities.

    Venn diagram, created using draw.io [#]_, illustrates the four pillars of
    Open Science |html-dash| Open Access, Open Research, Open Code, and Open
    Data. These interconnected principles promote transparency,
    collaboration, and accessibility in research, fostering a more trustworthy
    and inclusive scientific community.

To put things
simply, Open science is an umbrella term that encompasses various practices
aimed at making research more **transparent** and **accessible**. It covers
the entire research lifecycle, from data collection to publishing findings,
emphasizing openness and collaboration. You already might be doing open science
unknowningly if you are:

- Sharing research protocols openly or documenting code used for data analysis.
- Publishing in open-access journals or sharing preprints of research articles.
- Sharing raw datasets and detailed analysis scripts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Open Science Matters?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The importance of Open Science goes far beyond academia. In today's
interconnected world, scientific challenges are increasingly global and
complex. Problems like climate change, environmental justice, and natural
disasters demand cross-disciplinary solutions that involve many collaborators.
:term:`Open Science` breaks down silos, enabling diverse teams of researchers,
policymakers, and citizens to work together in solving real-world problems.

.. dropdown:: Reasons why open science is vital

    - **Transparency and Trust.** By making research processes visible and
      open to scrutiny, Open Science enhances trust in scientific findings.
