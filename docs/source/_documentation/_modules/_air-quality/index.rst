Welcome to the second module of the SCHOOL curriculum!

The Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is
part of the |website-tops| Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to teach the
data science lifecycle using data from the NASA Earth Sciences division and to
foster an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the
SCHOOL Project and other modules on the `SCHOOL Project
home page <https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/>`_.

This TOPS SCHOOL module on the theme of "Air Quality and Health" provides a
foundational understanding of the complex interplay between air quality,
public health, and environmental justice. We will explore how we can use
spatial data for the study of air pollution, the sources and types of
pollutants, and their impacts on vulnerable communities. You will gain
critical insights into how environmental factors shape health outcomes. As you
engage with the lessons, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of key
concepts, including the composition of air, the significance of social
vulnerability, and the tools available for analyzing environmental data.
Ultimately, these lessons will empower you to contribute meaningfully to
discussions and actions pertaining to air quality and environmental justice.

The following lessons examine how poor air quality impacts human health. Each
lesson uses one or more datasets to walk users through accessing and analyzing
data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including: data
cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating
visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities, explore
the relationships with variables such as extreme temperatures, demographic and
socioeconomic factors, environmental injustice, and environmental disasters.

.. tip::

    **This module is designed to provide undergraduate students and early-career researchers with an introduction to the data science “life cycle” and sample code describing how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of air pollution and its impact on health.**

    Teaching earth science topics and coding skills in depth is beyond the
    scope of the SCHOOL Modules. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide
    users with the skills to adapt the skills learned in SCHOOL lessons to the
    users' own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science,

Module 2: Air Quality datasets and use cases cover:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Acquiring, Pre-Processing, and Visualizing Student-Monitored Data for New
    York City schools:** This lesson will emphasize the relationship between
    hazardous chronic air quality and socioeconomic characteristics of
    different New York City school environments.

    *   `Lesson 1: Acquiring, Pre-Processing, and Visualizing
        Student-Monitored Data for New York City schools <https://
        ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-air-quality/
        m201-student-led-monitoring-nyc.html>`_

*   **Exploring Air Quality, Social Vulnerability, and Health Outcomes in Metro
    Detroit:** Participants will investigate how the Social Vulnerability
    Index (SVI) highlights areas at greater risk for adverse health outcomes
    due to environmental hazards. This lesson will examine the connections
    between socioeconomic status, health disparities, and environmental
    injustice.

    *   `Lesson 2: Exploring Air Quality, Social Vulnerability, and Health
        Outcomes in Metro Detroit <https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/
        TOPSTSCHOOL-air-quality/m202-svi-tri-icis-places.html>`_

*   **Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJScreen):** Explore
    the environmental and demographic characteristics of a geographic area
    using the Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice
    screening and mapping tool.

    *   `Lesson 3: Exploring EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and
        Mapping Tool <https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/
        TOPSTSCHOOL-air-quality/m203-ejscreen.html>`_

*   **Particulate Matter Across Socioeconomic Strata of Countries:** Analyzing
    the Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index Version 1 (GRDIv1) and annual
    PM2.5 grids to explore global relationships between socioeconomic
    vulnerability and particulate matter concentrations over time. This lesson
    will provide insights into how air quality varies across different regions
    and its implications for public health, focusing on both local and global
    contexts.

    *   `Lesson 4: Particulate Matter Across Socioeconomic Strata of Countries
        <https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-air-quality/
        m204-grdiv1-pm25.html>`_

This course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Transform to Open
Science (TOPS) team, our SCHOOL Open Science team, open science Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs), and the SCHOOL Development team!
