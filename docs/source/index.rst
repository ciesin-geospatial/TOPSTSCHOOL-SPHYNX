We are thrilled to introduce you to **Science Core Heuristics for Open Science
Outcomes in Learning** (:term:`SCHOOL`), a flagship initiative under
|website-tops| Training program. SCHOOL represents our collective vision to
make science open, inclusive, and accessible to all. By joining SCHOOL, you're
becoming part of a transformative effort to empower learners worldwide. Our
mission is to inspire students, educators, and researchers to leverage NASA
Earth Science Applications and embrace the power of Open Science in solving
some of the world's most pressing challenges. Together, we're building a
global community of learners and innovators.

This page provides a detailed overview of SCHOOL's goals, pedagogy, and the
unique opportunities it offers. We invite you to explore, engage, and
contribute to this exciting journey.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHOOL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At its core, :term:`SCHOOL` is about bridging the gap between cutting-edge
science and practical education. This initiative is part of NASA's Open Source
Science Initiative (OSSI) and focuses on integrating NASA's Earth Science
Applications into the data science life cycle. We have developed a series of
**seven learning modules**, each designed to provide learners with hands-on
experience in applying Open Science principles to real-world problems. These
modules are suitable for both self-led online learning and in-person
instruction, ensuring flexibility and accessibility for diverse audiences.

.. rubric:: Why is SCHOOL Special?
    :heading-level: 3

#. **Thematic Depth.** Each module explores a critical theme affecting our
   planet, including:

   - `Water.`_ Understanding water systems in a changing climate.
   - `Air Quality.`_ Connecting air quality data to public health
     outcomes.
   - **Environmental Justice.** Promoting equitable solutions to environmental
     challenges.
   - **Disasters.** Using data to predict, prepare for, and mitigate natural
     disasters.
   - **Wildfires.** Understanding and managing wildfire risks in vulnerable
     areas.
   - **Agriculture.** Enhancing food security through data-driven
     decision-making.
   - **Climate.** Addressing the urgent challenges posed by climate change.

#. **Data Science Life Cycle Integration.** Modules guide learners through
   the data science life cycle, demonstrating how to analyze, visualize, and
   derive insights from NASA datasets.
#. **Open Science Focus.** By emphasizing :term:`transparency` and
   collaboration, SCHOOL equips learners with the skills to contribute
   meaningfully to the global :term:`Open Science` community.

Pedagogy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At SCHOOL, we believe that how we teach is just as important as what we teach.
Our pedagogy is rooted in principles of inclusive teaching, active learning,
and thoughtful evaluation. These core values ensure that every learner feels
welcomed, empowered, and supported throughout their educational journey.

.. dropdown:: Inclusive Teaching

    Education should reflect the richness of the world we live in. At
    :term:`SCHOOL`, we strive to create an environment where diversity is not
    just acknowledged but celebrated. Here's how we foster inclusivity:

    - **Breaking Down Barriers.** Course content includes examples that cross
      cultural, gender, and socioeconomic boundaries, ensuring relevance for
      all learners.
    - **Diverse Modes of Learning.** Materials are delivered through a variety
      of methods, including videos, visuals, interactive exercises, and text.
      This multimodal approach ensures that learners with different
      preferences and abilities can engage fully.
    - **Accessible Design.** Every module is crafted to accommodate learners
      from diverse backgrounds and skill levels, eliminating assumptions about
      prior experience.

.. dropdown:: Active Learning

    We want learners to not just consume knowledge but to actively engage with
    it. Active learning encourages students to reflect, analyze, and apply
    concepts in real-time. Here's what you can expect:

    - **Critical Thinking.** Activities are designed to go beyond rote
      memorization, prompting learners to ask why and how.
    - **Engaging Tasks.** Modules include dynamic exercises such as coding
      challenges, data visualization tasks, and discussions.
    - **Interactive Content.** Even in self-led settings, learners are guided
      to interact with content, such as exploring datasets, connecting
      concepts to real-world scenarios, or engaging in problem-solving
      exercises.

.. dropdown:: Thoughtful Evaluation

    Effective learning relies on clear goals and constructive feedback. SCHOOL
    employs a rigorous evaluation process to help learners succeed:

    - **Transparent Expectations.** Learners know from the start what is
      expected and how their progress will be assessed.

    - **Timely Feedback.** Frequent and detailed feedback ensures that
      students can refine their skills as they learn.
    - **Guidance Through Exemplars.** Clear examples of successful outcomes
      help learners aim for excellence.

    Our goal is to create a supportive feedback loop where learners feel
    encouraged and motivated to improve continuously.

Project Timeline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCHOOL Project represents an ambitious, collaborative journey toward
reshaping how Open Science is taught and learned. Our timeline spans two
years, beginning on **July 1, 2023**, and culminating on **June 30, 2025**,
offering ample opportunities for contributions, feedback, and refinement as we
move forward together.

To ensure the smooth and efficient development of SCHOOL's learning modules,
we are adopting the `Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) <https://
scaledagileframework.com>`_ methodology. This proven approach emphasizes
collaboration, flexibility, and incremental progress, allowing us to deliver
thematic content regularly and in manageable stages.
